                    <h4>Admission and Guidance Center</h4>
                    <p>Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is the provision of distance education opportunities in ways
                        that seek to mitigate or remove barriers to access, such as finances, prior learning, age,
                        social, work or family commitments, disability , incarceration or other such barriers. “Open”
                        refers to a commitment that removes any unnecessary barriers to access learning. Distance
                        education refers to teaching and learning that temporarily separates teacher and learner in time
                        and/or place; uses multiple media for delivery of instruction; involves two-way communication
                        and possibly occasional face-to-face meeting for tutorials and learner-learner interaction. Open
                        learning is not the same as distance learning, but both are complementary and hence the two
                        terms are often used together as open and distance learning.</p>

                    <h4>How to Pass from NIOS / BOSSE Board in Class 10th &amp; 12th ? </h4>
                    <p>There are so many students who are good in one subject but poor in others which results to FAIL
                        in final exams.Here We started Nios Coaching in Nagercoil and Nios Admission in Nagercoil. In
                        NIOS / BOSSE, you can appear for few subjects in first half of the year and for the remaining
                        subject next half of the session. In this way students can pass a simple subject and a difficult
                        subject first and then pass the remaining subjects later. If someone has failed in class 9 or 11
                        and wants to take the class 10th or 11th exam without class again then NIOS / BOSSE is the best
                        option for them.</p>

                        <h4>What is NIOS ?</h4>
                        <p>NIOS is an “Open School” that caters to the needs of a heterogeneous group of learners up to pre-degree level. It was started as a project with in-built flexibilities by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in 1979. In 1986, the National Policy on Education suggested strengthening of Open School System for extending open learning facilities in a phased manner at secondary level all over the country as an independent system with its own curriculum and examination leading to certification.
                        </p>
                        <p>

Consequently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India set up the National Open School (NOS) in November 1989. The pilot project of CBSE on Open School was amalgamated with NOS. Through a Resolution (No. F.5-24/90 Sch.3 dated 14 September 1990 published in the Gazette of India on 20 October 1990), the National Open School (NOS) was vested with the authority to register, examine and certify students registered with it up to pre-degree level courses. In July 2002, the Ministry of Human Resource Development amended the nomenclature of the organisation from the National Open School (NOS) to the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) with a mission to provide relevant continuing education at school stage, up to pre-degree level through Open Learning system to prioritized client groups as an alternative to formal system, in pursuance of the normative national policy documents and in response to the need assessments of the people, and through it to make its share of contribution To universalisation of education,
To greater equity and justice in society, and 
To the evolution of a learning society.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There are so many students who are good in one subject but poor in others which results to FAIL
                        in final exams. In NIOS, you can appear for few subjects in first half of the year and for the
                        remaining subject next half of the session.

                        <h4>What is NIOS ?</h4>
                        <p>NIOS is an “Open School” that caters to the needs of a heterogeneous group of learners up to
                            pre-degree level. It was started as a project with in-built flexibilities by the Central
                            Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in 1979. In 1986, the National Policy on Education
                            suggested strengthening of Open School System for extending open learning facilities in a
                            phased manner at secondary level all over the country as an independent system with its own
                            curriculum and examination leading to certification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consequently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India set up
                            the National Open School (NOS) in November 1989. The pilot project of CBSE on Open School
                            was amalgamated with NOS. Through a Resolution (No. F.5-24/90 Sch.3 dated 14 September 1990
                            published in the Gazette of India on 20 October 1990), the National Open School (NOS) was
                            vested with the authority to register, examine and certify students registered with it up to
                            pre-degree level courses. In July 2002, the Ministry of Human Resource Development amended
                            the nomenclature of the organisation from the National Open School (NOS) to the National
                            Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) with a mission to provide relevant continuing education
                            at school stage, up to pre-degree level through Open Learning system to prioritized client
                            groups as an alternative to formal system, in pursuance of the normative national policy
                            documents and in response to the need assessments of the people, and through it to make its
                            share of contribution:

                            To universalisation of education,
                            To greater equity and justice in society, and
                            To the evolution of a learning society.

                                <div class="accordion-item-desc">Wasting time is something that a student can do even in
                                    regular school. Even very established institutions have regular cases of students
                                    who drop out because they have not managed their time well. From what we see in
                                    regular schools, it is by now established that regular tests are not a reliable way
                                    of learning. What we are talking about in NIOS is learning in its true essence. Once
                                    it comes to that, you don’t need any external stimuli to perform. Here we should
                                    differentiate between true learning and just preparing for a test. These two are
                                    vastly different in both content and outcome. Please note that NIOS has no students,
                                    only learners. It is for those who consider their books and study material an
                                    integral part of their journey of life.</div>

                                    work-filled as regular school. In this context, it would be relevant to mention that
                                    in many prestigious engineering colleges in India, there are students currently
                                    pursuing their masters’ program wherein they had done their under-grad in

                                    and some state boards have also adopted CCE for secondary school completion. CCE is
                                    supposed to bring in the advantage of holistic development of the child. How does
                                    the secondary program of NIOS compare with CCE?</label>
                                <div class="accordion-item-desc">
                                    A home-schooled child on an average spends 3 hours on pure academics, and the
                                    remaining waking time of the day is usually spent in other activities like sports,
                                    music, entertainment, general reading, pursuing a hobby, running errands or
                                    experimenting in the kitchen. All these activities are actually an enhanced version
                                    of CCE and therefore NIOS is exceptionally strong at upholding the values that CCE
                                    demands. When we also consider the fact that these extra-curricular activities are
                                    learnt on a nonregimented basis, it adds to the pleasure of learning. A big bonus
                                    here is the emotional stability and comfort that a home environment provides.
                                    Another small but not-often noticed advantage is avoiding the stress of wearing
                                    school uniform.

                                    final board exams. Whereas, in NIOS we need to study the chapters of XI std

                                    While technically it is true that the syllabus of NIOS includes XI std chapters for
                                    the board exams, you need to remember that you will have a lot more time available
                                    for preparation for the exams. Once you factor in the convenience of ODE, it becomes
                                    easier than what it looks. Incidentally, there are states like Andhra Pradesh whose
                                    senior secondary final exams include both XI and XII std syllabus

                                    Regular Schooling is a traditional method of face to face learning in a formal

                                    to his/her own schedule. The Open learning system is very helpful to learners who
